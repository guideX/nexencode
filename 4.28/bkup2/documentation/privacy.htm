          <p><STRONG>Team Nexgen's Statement of Privacy</STRONG></p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
          <P>At Team Nexgen, we are committed to protecting 
      your privacy and to developing technology that gives you the most powerful 
      and secure online experience. You can travel through most of our site 
      without giving us any information about yourself. But sometimes we do need 
      information to provide services that you request, and this statement of 
      privacy explains data collection and use in those situations. Please read 
      the complete Team Nexgen privacy statement.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p><b>Collecting your Personal Information</b></p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
      <p>We will ask you when we need information 
      that personally identifies you (personal information) or allows us to 
      contact you. Generally, this information is requested when you are asked 
      to register before entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, 
      joining a limited-access premium site, or when purchasing and 
      registering Team Nexgen products. Personal information collected 
      by Team Nexgen often is limited to e-mail address, language, 
      country or location, but may include other information when needed to 
      provide a service you requested.</p>
      <p>When you buy and install a new 
      product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you 
      do, we keep this registration information on file with any information 
      you've already given us on previous visits to our Web site. This is 
      considered your personal profile.</p></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <p><b>Use of your Personal Information</b></p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr>
      <p>We use your personal information for four primary purposes:</p>
      <UL>
        <LI>To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once. 
        <LI>To help you quickly find software, services or information on team-nexgen.com 
        <LI>To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you. 
        <LI>To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Team Nexgen.
        </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited 
      services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering 
      purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, 
      sending postal mail and processing event registration. We will only 
      provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, 
      and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</P>
      
      
      <p>Team Nexgen will disclose your personal information, without 
      notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that 
      such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or 
      comply with legal process served on Team Nexgen or the site; (b) 
      protect and defend the rights or property of Team Nexgen and its 
      family of Web sites, and, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the 
      personal safety of users of Team Nexgen, its Web sites, or the public. 
      </p></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P><b>Control of your Personal Information</b><p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr >
      
      <p>When you register, or otherwise give us personal 
      information, team-nexgen.com will not share that information with third 
      parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions 
      already listed. It will only be used for the purposes stated above.</p>
                
      <p>Team Nexgen may send out periodic e-mails informing 
      you of technical service issues related to a product or service you 
      requested. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these 
      mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have 
      chosen.</p></BLOCKQUOTE>

      your personal information and honors your choices for its intended use. We 
      carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or
