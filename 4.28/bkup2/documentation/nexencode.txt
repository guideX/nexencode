Known Problems

    Windows 95/Windows 98 Environments in most cases

  - FreeDB    fuzzy   match   is    not    yet    implemented


Problems / Solutions
  =================================
  P: I  encoded  a  file with NexENCODE, and it's all sped 
      up and distorted.
  S: The  file  needs to be the correct format. Open your 
      file  in  Windows  Sound  Recorder  and  save   it  as 
      44,100  Hz,  16bit,  Stereo,   then   open   it   up  in 
      NexENCODE.

  P: NexENCODE looks all funky and odd shaped
  S: Within  NexENCODE  Studio  their  is  a  skin  editor.
      Right  click  NexENCODE  choose  skin editor or visit
      www.team-nexgen.com    for   NexENCODE   Skins.

  P: I put a cd in the drive, but NexENCODE either tells 
      me that it's not there, or that the cd drive that the
      cd is in cannot be accessed.
  S: This  could be due to a couple of things. You could 
      have    another    cd   player,   or   ripper  running.
      In  that  case,  turn  it  off, and  try  accessing the
      cd drive with NexENCODE again. If you have more
      than  one  cd drive, right click NexENCODE choose 
      settings/ripper, then choose a cd drive.

  P: NexENCODE wont load.
  S: This  is  probably  due  to a bad executable or bad 
       distribution.  Sometimes  during   development,  a 
       bad one gets out on accident, and is usually fixed
       in   a    few    days     with    newer    versions   on 
       www.team-nexgen.com

  P: There's a problem that I have isn't in here.
  S: contact     me      thru      my      e-mail      address.
       brendlefly3000@hotmail.com,    or     my   helpfull 
       aprentice yoda...             yodasexy@hotmail.com

  P: NexENCODE sucks, I want to delete it!
  S: Go   to   Control   Panel,    add/remove  programs. 
      Deleteing  it  without uninstalling will cause system 
      problems
